# The D2C workflow (v1.0)
This is the first iteration of my Design-to-Code (D2C) workflow, which follows two stages of "De-constructing & Re-constructing" in design and code.

## What this repo contains
This repository contains all the resources that assist the d2c process.
It is aimed to serve as a boilerplate that would speed up d2c. 

## Permissions and Contributions
Anyone may fork this repository and make pull requests suggesting additions to the workflow.

# The Current Workflow. (v1.0)
This workflow follows two stages of "De-constructing & Re-constructing".

## De-construction
1. Deconstruction
    1. Accessing all resources.
        1. Design resources
            1. Media (images, videos, and icons)
            2. Fonts and font-weights
            3. Text
            4. Links
        2. Web resources
            1. javascript libraries
            2. CSS frameworks
        3. Layout information
            1. Components
            2. Break points
            3. Paddings and margins.
    2. Organizing them into folders and logs.
    
## Reconstruction
    1. Setting up dev environment.
    2. Component building spree with pug.js
    3. Styling spree with Sass.
    4. Deploying.

## Possible additions I'm pondering...
* should I make a basic wire-frame first?
